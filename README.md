# Single header neural network library

## For people who love to wait for the compiler to finish compiling.
This project includes excessive use of the C++ templating engine for amusement purposes.

## Comptime-checked neural networks
The heavy use of templating allows us to check if all layers are in the right shape.
TODO: Make it possible to embed pre-trained NN in an executable for faster response times.

## Examples:
Current examples include a MNIST digit-recogniser, which achieves 91% at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer), and a [visualisator](atanasdimitrov.xyz/digit/), which uses the aforementioned network.
